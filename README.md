## 1.1.3 Colour Choices
##### 1) Black - #000000
With the exception of the red text on the Contact Us Page, black will be used for all text e.g. paragraphs, headings, and navbar tabs. 

##### 2) Red - #cc0000
Used to highlight the importance of filling out the form on the Contact Us page. 


##### 3) White - #ffffff
Applied to the background of each page to create the illusion  of negative space, as well as a textual hover effect for all buttons. 
Also used as the background for articles found on the Recipes and About Us pages. 

##### 4) Green - #86be47
Used as an animated css hover effect on the navbar and as the default background for buttons on all pages.
Also used as a shadow effect for the textboxes on the About Us page.

## 1.1.4 Accessibility
The following measures have been taken to ensure that Vegan Detox adheres to W3C's accessibility standards.
##### 1) Bright colours for short-sighted people
Bright red, green, and white are used throughout the website to ensure that each component is visible for the user and accessible if needs be. 

##### 2) Understandable e.g. to the point and not overly complicated
Only the bare minimum of text is available on the website. This is so as not to overburden the user with information. Less is more in this case.
Furthermore, just as much information is visually conveyed, if not more. 
 
In addition, users also have the option to use the zoom in/out function on their PCs if they'd prefer to increase/decrease the size of the text. 

## 1.2.5 GDPR
##### 1) Creating a privacy policy
In order to ensure users can trust the legitimacy of Vegan Detox a privacy policy was created.
This is a legal requirement even though the site is not ecommerce related. As long as personal information is being collected e.g. email addresses, 
then a policy will be required to specify that we will not share or sell any personal information to third parties.
