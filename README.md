The following measures have been taken to ensure that Vegan Detox adheres to W3C's accessibility standards.
##### 1) Bright colours for short-sighted people
Bright red, green, and white are used throughout the website to ensure that each component was visible for the user and accessible if needs be. 

##### 2) Understandable e.g. to the point and not overly complicated
Only the bare minimum of text is available on the website. This is so as not to overburden the user with information. Less is more in this case.
Furthermore, just as much information is visually conveyed, if not more. 
 
In addition, users also have the option use the zoom in/out function on their PCs if they would prefer to increase/decrease the size of the text.
