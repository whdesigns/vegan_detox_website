        <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
        <p>Thank you for checking out our Privacy Policy Page where we discuss the security of our site, how your personal information will be stored safely and the 8 Individual Rights you have when it comes to how your data is used.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Personal Information</strong></h3>
        <p>We promise that we will not share or distribute your information with third parties.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>How is the information used?</strong></h3>
        <p>When a user inputs their information into the form on our Contact Us page their email address will be securely stored in our database. We will not share this information with third parties and will only use your email to share new recipes, and
            the latest Vegan Detox news.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Use of Links</strong></h3>
        <p>On our Recipes Page, we provide links to external sites. Vegan Detox take no responsibility for, and exercise no control over, the referenced companies, views and opinions.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Use of text and images</strong></h3>
        <p>If you would like to link your recipe to Vegan Detox, please contact us beforehand.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><strong>Accessibility</strong></h3>
        <p>The colours chosen on this website were designed to not only appear bright and aesthetically appeasing but also to benefit those who are short-sighted. We welcome any comments or queries that could help us improve the usability for those with
            disabilities. The text is also appropriately sized, but each browser should also have a zoom option to enhance the size of the text, should it appear too small for some users. </p>
        <br>

        <h3><strong>Contacting Us</strong></h3>
        <p>While we would prefer you contact us via the form on the contact page, if you have an urgent query or cannot access the website please email info@vegandetox.com.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><strong>Opt-out</strong></h3>
        <p>If you wish to opt out of our mailing-list please click “unsubscribe” on a confirmation email you will receive upon filling out the form on the Contact Us Page. Once received, we will remove you from the database and you will no longer receive
            updates or new recipes from us.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Accuracy</strong></h3>
        <p>If for whatever reason you change your email address please either fill out the form again or email us on info@vegandetox.com and we will erase your old and add the new one. Vegan Detox will provide confirmation of corrections and deletions via
            the email you provided.
        </p>
        <br>


        <h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
        <p>Protecting your personal information is paramount to us and we take appropriate actions to protect it. For example, the servers we use are monitored vigilantly, the site is protected by SSL certificate to ensure it is protected, user and browser
            friendly. That said, despite our best efforts, no action taken online is ever 100% secure, therefore, whilst we endeavour to protect all personal information you provide, we cannot guarantee the security of any information which you decide
            to disclose online, meaning you must go in with the knowledge that you take action at your own risk. In addition, we pride ourselves with trying to protect your information offline too. E.g. our database is security encrypted meaning that
            your personal information is only accessible to employees of Vegan Detox who need it. For this reason, that information will only be used to send out updates and new recipes to the users of the provided email addresses.</p>

    <div id="rights_heading">
        <h2><strong>Your 8 Individual Rights</strong></h2>
    </div>


    <div class="rights_content">

        <h3><strong>1. The right to be informed</strong></h3>
        <p>The user has the right to be informed about how his/her data is processed. This means that the information must conform to the following: 1. Be concise, transparent, and accessible for all users 2. Composed in a simple way e.g. as if it was designed
            for a child. 3. Must be free of charge
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3><strong>2. The right of access</strong></h3>
        <p>Vegan Detox will provide processing confirmation and access to an individual’s information free of charge and provide it via email if the request is made. This will likely only occur when it comes to cancelling a subscription after filling in
            the form on the Contact Us Page.</p>

        <br>


        <h3><strong>3. The right to rectification</strong></h3>
        <p>As per the law all users are entitled to have their personal data rectified if they inputted inaccurate data or that previous data provided has since changed. In the case of Vegan Detox the user will simply need to fill in the form again or submit
            a query to info@vegandetox.com and the company will address the query with 24 hours or less. </p>

        <br>

        <h3><strong>4. The right to erasure</strong></h3>
        <p>This legal right means that the user can request Vegan Detox erase their personal data. This would apply when the following reasons arise: • When the individual unsubscribes from our mailing list. • If the data is unintentionally shared with third
            parties e.g. the site is breached. This reason is also prudent when it comes down to marketing. E.g. some users may not be happy with their personal being kept on a database that is alien to them and at some point, may choose to have their
            data deleted from it for fear it will be shared with third parties.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3><strong>5. The right to restrict processing</strong></h3>
        <p>Users will also have the legal right to restrict the processing of any personal data. This relates to the following circumstances: • “A user might argue that some of the data being kept is inaccurate. At that point the processing of their data
            should desist, until further confirmation from the user is received. • The user may not entirely trust Vegan Detox and as a result may withdraw consent for us to utilize their data. At that point erasure of their data should occur. • If the
            user has not been responsive in over a year in regard to email enquiries Vegan Detox distributed then that user’s personal data should be erased from our database.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3><strong>6. The right to data portability</strong></h3>
        <p>This legal right permits the use of data portability e.g. to obtain and reuse the user’s personal data across miscellaneous services. However, this will only apply to Vegan Detox if the processing is automated, which it is via use of our online
            database. The objective of this right is to permeate the copy or transfer of personal data more easily and efficiently from one location to another securely, without compromising usability. This right is usually intended for transactions,
            but because Vegan Detox is a non-ecommerce site it is unlikely any user will have use for this right.
        </p>


        <br>

        <h3><strong>7. The right to object</strong></h3>
        <p>This right means that users have a legal right to object over how their data is used with Vegan Detox e.g. some may not like our email driven approach and may view it as spam. If that occurs processing of their information must desist as soon
            as the company is notified of this objection by the user. </p>

        <br>


        <h3><strong>8. Rights related to automated decision making and profiling</strong></h3>
        <p>This right is in reference to how data is automated and the profiling and decision making that determines how the user’s data is used. Vegan Detox will not share any data with third parties and will only contact you via email with vegan information
            e.g. new recipes. However, each user has a legal right not to be subject to a decision made without their consent. This right is related more to sites that use cookies and are ecommerce based. The purpose of Vegan Detox is only to educate
            and add variety to meal preparation.</p>
